 The key objectives are to identify historical trends, detect anomalies, and simulate future scenarios to evaluate potential policy outcomes.

To begin, it is essential to analyze historical data to gain a clear understanding of how CO₂ concentrations and temperature anomalies have changed over time. By identifying long-term trends and correlations, the analysis can reveal the underlying relationship between these variables. This approach also involves examining the impact of industrialization and other human-driven factors on climate patterns, offering deeper insights into the forces shaping our environment.

Secondly, identifying anomalies in temperature and CO₂ levels can uncover critical events that deviate from established patterns. These irregularities may signal natural phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions, or human-induced activities, like sudden increases in industrial emissions. Analyzing the origins of these outliers offers valuable insights into the underlying drivers of climate variability.

Ultimately, the study seeks to simulate "what-if" scenarios to predict the effects of changes in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations on global temperatures. For example, it explores the potential outcomes of CO₂ levels rising or falling by specific percentages. These simulations provide a quantitative foundation for shaping climate policies, highlighting the critical importance of reducing emissions to curb global warming. By uncovering these trends, governments and organizations can make informed, data-driven decisions to combat climate change more effectively.
